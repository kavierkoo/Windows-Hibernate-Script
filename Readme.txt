Hibernate Script is a simple program scripted with Auto Hot Key and Visual Basic.

The program basically allow users to double confirm if they were intended to hibernate the windows PC and if users agreed to hibernate, it will count down for 10 second for users to cancel the action if they misclicked to trigger hibernate too.

This program is coded because I set one of my shortcut key on keyboard as Hibernate and sometimes when i accidentally clicked that button, it will require me to waste my time to get it back on.
So I coded this small program to help to double confirm the hibernation action as well as a countdown as if  i clicked it too fast.

Recently I added Text to speech features just for fun
